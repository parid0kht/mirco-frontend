difference between library and micro frontend:
library -> collection of code that is compiled into your application. consumer opts for a new implementation. similar to an installed application
service -> an external capability that you access from your application. provider provides a new implementation. similar to SaaS

idea of micro frontend: think about a web app as a composition of features which are owned by different teams 
pros:
1. team scalability
